Fine-tuned RaSP(Rapid Stability Predictor) the supervised model to accurately predict protein stability from input protein sequences. Results in increased accuracy by reducing Mean Absolute Error by 9%.

Reduced MAE from 0.995 -> 0.907

Increased Pearson correlation coefficient by 3.3% (0.767 -> 0.804)
